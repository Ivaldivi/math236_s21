## Traffic Flow

Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction. 
The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6
streets that lead into and out of this area.  Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves 
each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying).

1. Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$.

2. Use RStudio to find the solution set. Write your answer in parametric form.  

3. Your  answer to part 2 finds an infinite solution set. In terms of **traffic flow**, explain  why there can be more than one solution. Thinking about cars traveling along streets, why is there some flexibility in the overall flow of cars? 

4. Now critique the model as presented. What solutions to the linear system are problematic for our original traffic flow problem? What additional conditions should we require for a valid solution?





## Parabolas Through Two Points

You will find the family of all possible parabolas
$$
f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c
$$ 
through two given points. Note that there will be an infinite number of such polynomials: there are three unknowns, but only two constraints. So there will be at least one free variable. Here are the  plots of the two different families of parabolas that you will consider.

![](images/ps1-parab2.png){width=40%}
</center>

1. For each pair of points, (a) create linear system that represents the problem (b) use RStudio to find the RREF of the augmented matrix for the system and (c) write down the general formula for the family of parabolas $f(x)$ that contain the points.
    1. $p_1 = (1,0)$ and $p_2 = (5,0)$


    2. $q_1= (1,-3)$ and $q_2 =  (5,10)$

2. Part 1.1 characterizes the family of parabolas that contain the points 
$p_1$ and $p_2$. Let's refer to this family of parabolas as our "$p_1,p_2$ family." Pick any two functions $g_1(x)$ and $g_2(x)$ from this $p_1,p_2$ family of parabolas. Now consider the parabola
$$
g(x) = g_1(x) - g_2(x).
$$
Show that $g(1)=0$ and $g(5)=0$. This means that $g(x)$ is also in our $p_1,p_2$ family! (That's realy cool!)



3. Part 1.2 characterizes the family of parabolas that contain the points 
$q_1$ and $q_2$. Let's refer to this family of parabolas as our "$q_1,q_2$ family."  Pick any two functions $h_1(x)$ and $h_2(x)$ in this $q_1,q_2$ family. Now consider the parabola
$$
h(x) = h_1(x) - h_2(x).
$$
Show that $h(1) \neq -1$ and $h(5) \neq 10$. This means that $h(x)$ is NOT in our $q_1,q_2$ family. (So this family is not as nice as the previous one.)


4. Now explain why the parabola $h(x)$ from part 3 is actually a member of the $p_1, p_2$ family. (So maybe this family is nicer than we thought!)

<!-- 
4. Now take a step back. I want you to make some observations about these two families, and the relation between them.  In particular: 
    + What special property of the $p_1,p_2$ family leads to the nice behavior of $g(x)$ part 2? (Or equivalently: what goes wrong for the $q_1,q_2$ family in part 3?) 
     + What **can** you say about the parabola $h(x) = h_1(x) - h_2(x)$ in part 3? 
     + What is the connection between the $q_1, q_2$ family and the $p_1, p_2$ family? 
-->

**Remark:** This problem is about families of parabolas. But at its core, this is actually a problem about linear algebra. 

* Obviously, we used linear algebra to solve part 1, but there is linear algebra in the other parts as well!
* We define $g(x) = g_1(x) - g_2(x)$ by taking a **linear combination** of two functions. (Just like we take linear combinations of vectors.)
* What leads to the "nice" behavior of the $p_1, p_2$ family in part 2? It's because the $y$-values of the constraining points are both 0. We will soon learn about **homogeneous** linear systems whose right hand sides are all zero. These homogeneous systems have some very special properties.
* The $q_1, q_2$ family is "not nice" because it a **nonhomogenous system**.
* Just as there is a connection betwen the $p_1,p_2$ family and the $q_1, q_2$ family, we will soon learn that there is a connection between homogeneous systems and nonhomogeneous systems.
