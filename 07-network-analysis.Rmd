In this example, we will use a package called `igraph`. To install it, you need to go to the packages window (bottom right), choose `install`, and search for and install `igraph` from the packages window.

```{r,message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(igraph)
```
The igraph R package isn't all that well documented. Here are some places to look for documentation if you want to learn about other features. Let me know if you find any other good references:

## Graphs and Networks

Graphs consists of **vertices** and the **edges** between them. These edges are used to model connections in a wide array of applications, including but not limited to, physical, biological, social, and information networks. To emphasize the application to real-world systems, the term *Network Science* is sometimes used. So we will use the terms **graph** and **network** interchangeably. 

In this application question, we will see that linear algebra is an important tool in the study of graphs. 

### Adjacency Matrices

Matrices are used to represent graphs and networks in a very direct way: we place a 1 in position $(i,j)$ of the **adjacency matrix** $A$ of the graph $G$, if there is an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ in $G$. 

Here is the adjacency matrix we will use today. As you can see it is a $12 \times 12$ matrix.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
A = rbind(
  c(0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0),
  c(1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0),
  c(0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0),
  c(1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0),
  c(0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1),
  c(0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0),
  c(0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0),
  c(0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0),
  c(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0),
  c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0),
  c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0),
  c(0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0))
A
dim(A)
```


Here is how to make the graph from your adjacency matrix

```{r, network1, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, echo=TRUE}
g=graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A,mode='undirected')
plot(g, vertex.color='tan1', vertex.frame.color="dodgerblue")
```

Observe that there is an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ if and only if there is a 1 in position $(i,j)$ in the matrix. 

Let's assume that this network is the route map of a small airline. Let's add vertex labels and change the vertex size:

```{r, network2, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, echo=TRUE}
airports = 
  c("ATL","LAX","ORD","MSP","DEN","JFK","SFO","SEA","PHL","PDX","MDW","LGA")
V(g)$label = airports
plot(g,vertex.size=30, vertex.color='tan1', vertex.frame.color="dodgerblue")
```

### Graph Layouts

There are a variety of graph layout algorithms which place the vertices in the plane. You can find many algorithms [in the igraph documentation](https://igraph.org/c/doc/igraph-Layout.html). For example, here is a layout on a circle

```{r,  network3, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, echo=TRUE}
coords = layout_in_circle(g)
plot(g, layout=coords, vertex.size = 30,vertex.label.cex=0.65, vertex.color='tan1', vertex.frame.color="dodgerblue")
```

The **Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm** is one of the most popular graph vertex layout algorithms. It is a force-directed layout that tries to get a nice-looking graph where edges are similar in length and cross each other as little as possible. The algorithm simulates the graph as a physical system. Vertices are electrically charged particles that repulse each other when they get too close. The edges act as springs that attract connected vertices closer together. As a result, vertices are evenly distributed through the chart area. The resulting layout is intuitive: vertices which share more connections are closer to each other. 

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=6, echo=TRUE}
coords = layout_with_fr(g)
plot(g, layout=coords, vertex.size = 30, vertex.label.cex=0.65, vertex.color='tan1', vertex.frame.color="dodgerblue")
```

We can also choose to layout vertices by hand:

```{r, network4, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, echo=TRUE}
locations = rbind(
  c(20,0),c(-10,0),c(11,7),c(10,15),c(3,12),c(25,10),
  c(-10,10),c(-12,15),c(20,6),c(-15,12),c(12,4),c(25,13)
)
plot(g,vertex.size=20, layout=locations, vertex.label.cex=0.65, vertex.color='tan1', vertex.frame.color="dodgerblue")
```


## Degree Centrality



If we are considering placing an office in one of our airport locations, we may want to chose the most **central** hub for that office. It turns out that there are many interesting **centrality measures** for networks. We will talk about two of them today.


The simplest measure centrality is the **degree** of the vertex, or the number of edges connected to that vertex. We calculate the degree centralities from the adjacency matrix as follows:

1. First make a vector $\mathsf{v}$ of all 1's; then 
1. multiply $\mathsf{d} = A\mathsf{v}$ to get the degree proportions; and 
1. we also divide vector $\mathsf{d}$ by the sum of its entries. 

The result is a **normalized vector** $\mathsf{u}$ whose entries sum to 1. Each entry of vector $\mathsf{u}$ represents to proportion of edges incident with the corresponding vertex.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
v=rep(1,nrow(A)) # all 1s vector
d = A %*% v  # degrees
u=d/sum(d)   # proportion of degrees
cbind(d,u) # show d and u together side-by-side in a matrix
```

Now let's create a **data visualization.** We plot the network and size each vertex according to the vector $u$. The larger vertices have more edges connected to them. This conveys information to the viewer about the relative importance of the vertices. 

```{r, network5, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, echo=TRUE}
plot(g, layout=locations, vertex.size=250*u,vertex.label.cex=0.65, vertex.color='tan1', vertex.frame.color="dodgerblue")
```

We can also sort the vertices by degree. To include the vertex names, we do it in a **data frame**. WE then display the results in a 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df = data.frame(d)  # Convert vector to a data frame so that we can add row names
rownames(df)=airports
ii=order(d,decreasing=TRUE)
df2 = data.frame(df[ii,])
rownames(df2) = airports[ii]
df2
```
## Gould's Index

Gould's Index is a measure of centrality that uses the dominant eigenvector of a matrix. It was introduced by geographer P. R. Gould in 1967 to analyze the geographical features on maps. We will build up Gould's Index step-by-step so that we can understand what it measures. 

### Step 1

The first step is typically to add the identity matrix to the adjancency matrix $A$ to get a new matrix 
$$B= A + I.$$ 
The $n \times n$ identity matrix in `R` is obtained by using `diag(n)`. Adding the identity gives a connection from a vertex to itself. This **loop edge** corresponds to staying at the current city during a layover. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
(B = A + diag(nrow(A)))
```

Here is what the corresponding network (with layovers) looks like. You can see why we refer to these additional edges as "loops." However, we usually do not draw the network with these added loops to keep the figure less cluttered.


```{r, networkB, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, echo=TRUE}
g2=graph_from_adjacency_matrix(B,mode='undirected')
airports = 
  c("ATL","LAX","ORD","MSP","DEN","JFK","SFO","SEA","PHL","PDX","MDW","LGA")
V(g2)$label = airports
coords = layout_with_fr(g2)
plot(g2, layout=coords, vertex.color='tan1', vertex.frame.color="dodgerblue")
```


### Step 2

Start with the all 1's vector $\mathsf{v}_0 = [1, 1, \ldots ,1 ]^{\top}$. We iterate the mapping $T(\mathsf{x}) = B\mathsf{x}$ for a few steps to get $\mathsf{v}_1 = B \mathsf{v}_0$ and $\mathsf{v}_2 = B \mathsf{v}_1 = B^2 \mathsf{v}_0$ and $\mathsf{v}_3 = B \mathsf{v}_2 = B^3 \mathsf{v}_0$.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
v0 = rep(1,nrow(B))
v1 = B %*% v0
v2 = B %*% v1
v3 = B %*% v2

df = data.frame(cbind(v0,v1,v2,v3)) #Convert vector to a data frame in order to add row names
rownames(df)=airports
colnames(df)=c(0,1,2,3)
df

```

#### Your Turn

**Discuss with your group:** Each of the entries  of vector $\mathsf{v}_{t}$ corresponds to "a trip of length $k$." What kinds of trips does the $i$th entry of $\mathsf{v}_{t}$ count? Here is how you can figure this out:

1. Compare the table of vectors with the picture of the network with layovers.
1. Start by looking at the $t=1$ column. The $i$th entry has something to do with the $i$th city. 
1. Next, look at the $t=2$ column. And so on.
1. Once you have noticed the connection between the network and data, *explain why the rule $\mathsf{v}_t = A \mathsf{v}_{t-1}$ leads to this result*.

### Step 3

We can calculate $\mathsf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathsf{v}_{10}$ using a loop:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
N = 10 
X = matrix(0,nrow=nrow(B),ncol=N+1)
X[,1] = rep(1,nrow(B))
for (i in 2:(N+1)) {  
   X[,i] = B %*%  X[,i-1]
}
X 

df = data.frame(X) 
rownames(df)=airports
colnames(df)=c(0:10)
df
```

Wow, these numbers get big fast! Let's normalize by dividing by the sum each time.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
N = 10 
X = matrix(0,nrow=nrow(B),ncol=N+1)
X[,1] = rep(1,nrow(B))
for (i in 2:(N+1)) {  
   X[,i] = B %*%  X[,i-1]
   X[,i] = X[,i]/sum(X[,i])
}

df = data.frame(X) 
rownames(df)=airports
colnames(df)=c(0:10)
df
```


#### Your Turn

**Discuss with your group:** What do we learn from this table of normalized vectors?  

1. Interpret the vector for $t=10$. Since we have normalized our vector, each entry is a proportion, rather than a raw count.
1. Look at the entries as $t$ increases. What do you observe? 
1. Iterative multiplication $\mathsf{v}_t = A \mathsf{v}_{t-1}$ is a **dynamical system**! We talked about dynamical systems last week. There is a relationship between the eigenvectors of $A$ and the "long term behavior" of the dynamical system. Share what you remember about this topic with your group. 


### Step 4

You have observed that the vectors are converging to a common direction.  We get this final direction without saving all of the values along the way. Here we iterate 1000 steps and save the final value. This limiting vector, whose entries are scaled to sum to one, is called **Gould's Index**.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
N = 1000 
w = rep(1,nrow(B))
for (i in 2:(N+1)) {  
   w = B %*%  w
   w = w/sum(w)
}
df = data.frame(w)
rownames(df)=airports
colnames(df)=c("Gould Index")
df
```


We saw last week that this direction must be  the **dominant eigenvector** of $B$. This dominant eigenvector is the directon that corresponds to the eigenvalue of largest magnitude.

We can confirm that this is the dominant eigenvector as follows. First compute the eigenvectors.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
eigen(B)
```
Now, we will 

* extract the dominant eigenvector $\mathsf{v}_1$
* rescale this vector to sum to 1, and 
* display it next to the vector $w$ we got above by iteration. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
vecs = eigen(B)$vectors
gould = vecs[,1]
gould = gould/sum(gould)
cbind(w,gould)
```

### Step 5

Now let's plot the network with:

* the vertices sized by Gould's Index
* the labels sized by degree centrality

```{r, network6, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, eecho=TRUE}
plot(g, layout=locations, vertex.size=250*gould,vertex.label.cex=7*u, vertex.color='tan1', vertex.frame.color="dodgerblue" )
```

And we can create a data frame containing both the Gould's Index and the Degree Centrality. We  order the data using the Gould Index and then compare the two.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
df = data.frame(gould, u) #Convert vector to a data frame in order to add row names
rownames(df)=airports
colnames(df)=c('Gould', 'Degree')
ii=order(gould,decreasing=TRUE)
df2 = data.frame(df[ii,])
rownames(df2) = airports[ii]
df2
```

#### Your Turn

**Discuss with your group:** Degree centrality and Gould's Index give different rankings. Look at the table and observe that:

* LAX, DEN and SEA have the same degree centrality. However LAX and DEN have higher Gould Index than SEA.
* SFO has lower degree centrality than SEA, but higher Gould centrality! So these two centralities give different rankings.

Remind yourselves about the intuitive idea behind Gould's Index. What does Gould Index measure? 

* Why does the Gould Index value SFO more than SEA?
* Find another pair of cities where the rankings of degree centrality and Gould's Index differ. Look at the plot of the network and explain why this is the case.


### Gould Index Summary

Now that we understand what Gould's Index means, let's summarize how to find the Gould Index values for an adjacency matrix $A$.

1. Create the matrix $B = A+I$.
2. Find the dominant eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ of $B$.
3. Normalize the values of $\mathbf{v}$ so that the entries sum to 1.



## Your Turn: The Rise of Moscow

Russian historians often attribute the dominance and rise to power of Moscow to its strategic position on medieval trade routes (see Figure 1). Others argue that sociological and political factors aided Moscow’s rise to power, and thus Moscow did not rise to power strictly because of its strategic location on the trade routes. The figure below shows the major cities and trade routes of medieval Russia.

![](images/MedievalRussia.png){width=75%}

Let's use Gould’s Index to form a geographer's opinion about this debate. Either:

* Moscow’s location was the primary reason for its rise to power, or 
* Other forces must have come into play.

Here is the adjacency matrix for this transportation network into an adjacency matrix and a plot of the network.

### Find the degree centrality values.

Create a vector containing the normalized Degree Centralities. See Section \@ref(degree-centrality) for help.

### Find the Gould Index values

Create a vector containing the Gould Index values. See Section \@ref(gould-index-summary) for help.

### Analyze the Data

* Plot the network where the size of the vertices is determined by Gould's Index and the size of the label is determined by degree centrality.
* Create a data frame that contains Gould's Index and Degree Centralities. The rows should be labeled with the city names and the columns should be named by the centrality measures.  Sort according to Gould's Index. 
* Use Gould's Index to decide whether Moscow's dominance was solely due to its geographic location.
* Compare the Gould's Index and Degree Centrality rankings and note any interesting findings.

See Section \@ref(step-5) for help.
