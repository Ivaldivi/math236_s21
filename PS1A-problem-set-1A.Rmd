## Characterize the Solution Set

The following augmented matrices are in row echelon form. Decide whether the set of solutions  is a point, line, plane, or the empty set in 3-space. Briefly justify your answer.

a.
$\left[
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 3 & -1 & 4 \\
0 & 1 & 4   & 0\\
0 &  0 & 0  & 2 \\
\end{array}
\right]$

b.
$\left[
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 3 & -1 & 5 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 &  0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right]$

c.
$\left[
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & -1 & 0  & -2 \\
0 & 0 & 1  & 7\\
0 &  0 & 0 & 1\\

\right]$

d.
$\left[ 
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
0 & 1 & 0 & 6 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & -2 \\
0 &  0 & 0 & 0 \\

## Find the Parametric Solution

b.
$\left[
\begin{array}{ccccc|c}
1 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 3 & 6\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -2& -8 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 3 \\

1 & 4 & 0 & 0 & -2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 7  & 6\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0  & 0 \\

\right]$




## Elementary row operations are reversible 
In each case below, an elementary row operation turns the matrix $A$ into the  matrix $B$. For each of them,

* Describe the row operation that turns $A$ into $B$, and 
* Describe the row operation that turns $B$ into $A$. 

Give your answers in the form: "scale $R_2$ by 3" or "swap $R_1$  and $R_4$" or "replace $R_3$ with $R_3 + \frac{1}{5} R_1$."

a.
$$A=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
 1 & -2 & 2 & 1 \\
 2 & 8 & 2 & -4 \\
 3 & 1 & 6 & -1 \\
\end{array}
\right]\longrightarrow 
B=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
 1 & -2 & 2 & 1 \\
 2 & 8 & 2 & -4 \\
 0 & 7 & 0 & -4 \\
\end{array}
\right]$$

b.
$$A=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
 1 & -2 & 2 & 1 \\
 2 & 8 & 2 & -4 \\
 3 & 1 & 6 & -1 \\
\end{array}
\right]\longrightarrow 
B=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & -2 & 2 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
 2 & 8 & 2 & -4 \\
 3 & 1 & 6 & -1 \\
\end{array}
\right]$$

c.
$$A=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
 1 & -2 & 2 & 1 \\
 2 & 8 & 2 & -4 \\
 3 & 1 & 6 & -1 \\
\end{array}
\right]\longrightarrow 
B=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
 1 & -2 & 2 & 1 \\
 1 & 4 & 1 & -2 \\
 3 & 1 & 6 & -1 \\
\end{array}
\right]$$

## Designer Parabolas

In each part below, set up and solve a linear system of equations to find **all** possible parabolas of the form
$$
f(x) = a + b x + c x^2
$$ 
that satisfy the given conditions. You can either solve these by hand or by using RStudio or WolframAlpha. If you use software, submit the commands that you used to solve the system.

a. $f(x)$ passes through the three points: $(1,3), (3,11),(2,4)$.

b. $f(x)$ passes through the three points: $(1,3), (3,11),(3,10)$.

c. $f(x)$ passes through the three points: $(1,3)$ and $(3,11)$.




## Traffic Flow

Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction.  The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area.  Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying).

a. Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$.

b. Use RStudio to find the solution set. Give the general solution to this system of equations.  

c. Your  answer to part b should ber an infinite solution set. Give two distinct solutions that are realistic in terms of  **traffic flow**.

d. Is it possible to close down the street labeled by $x_2$ for road construction? That is, is it possible to have $x_2 = 0$ and to meet the other conditions?
