Decide whether the set of solutions is a point, line, plane, or the empty set in 3-space. Briefly justify your answer. \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 5 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 6 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) 1.2 Find the Parametric Solution Each of the following matrices is the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations.

For each of them, Describe the row operation that turns \\(A\\) into \\(B\\), and Describe the row operation that turns \\(B\\) into \\(A\\). Give your answers in the form: “scale \\(R_2\\) by 3” or “swap \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_4\\)” or “replace \\(R_3\\) with \\(R_3 + \\frac{1}{5} R_1\\).” \\[A=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\longrightarrow B=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; 0 &amp; -4 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\] \\[A=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\longrightarrow B=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\] \\[A=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\longrightarrow B=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\] 1.4 Traffic Flow Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction. The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area. Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying). Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\). Use RStudio to find the solution set. Write your answer in parametric form. Your answer to part 2 finds an infinite solution set. In terms of traffic flow, explain why there can be more than one solution. Thinking about cars traveling along streets, why is there some flexibility in the overall flow of cars? Now critique the model as presented. What solutions to the linear system are problematic for our original traffic flow problem? What additional conditions should we require for a valid solution? 1.5 Parabolas Through Two Points You will find the family of all possible parabolas \\[ f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \\] through two given points. Note that there will be an infinite number of such polynomials: there are three unknowns, but only two constraints. So there will be at least one free variable. Here are the plots of the two different families of parabolas that you will consider. For each pair of points, (a) create linear system that represents the problem (b) use RStudio to find the RREF of the augmented matrix for the system and (c) write down the general formula for the family of parabolas \\(f(x)\\) that contain the points. \\(p_1 = (1,0)\\) and \\(p_2 = (5,0)\\) \\(q_1= (1,-3)\\) and \\(q_2 = (5,10)\\) Part 1.1 characterizes the family of parabolas that contain the points \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\). Let’s refer to this family of parabolas as our “\\(p_1,p_2\\) family.” Pick any two functions \\(g_1(x)\\) and \\(g_2(x)\\) from this \\(p_1,p_2\\) family of parabolas. Now consider the parabola \\[ g(x) = g_1(x) - g_2(x). \\] Show that \\(g(1)=0\\) and \\(g(5)=0\\). This means that \\(g(x)\\) is also in our \\(p_1,p_2\\) family! (That’s really cool!) Part 1.2 characterizes the family of parabolas that contain the points \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\). Let’s refer to this family of parabolas as our “\\(q_1,q_2\\) family.” Pick any two functions \\(h_1(x)\\) and \\(h_2(x)\\) in this \\(q_1,q_2\\) family. Now consider the parabola \\[ h(x) = h_1(x) - h_2(x). \\] Show that \\(h(1) \\neq -3\\) and \\(h(5) \\neq 10\\). This means that \\(h(x)\\) is NOT in our \\(q_1,q_2\\) family. (So this family is not as nice as the previous one.) Now explain why the parabola \\(h(x)\\) from part 3 is actually a member of the \\(p_1, p_2\\) family. (So maybe this family is nicer than we thought!) Remark: This problem is about families of parabolas. But at its core, this is actually a problem about linear algebra. Obviously, we used linear algebra to solve part 1, but there is linear algebra in the other parts as well! We define \\(g(x) = g_1(x) - g_2(x)\\) by taking a linear combination of two functions. (Just like we take linear combinations of vectors.) What leads to the “nice” behavior of the \\(p_1, p_2\\) family in part 2? It’s because the \\(y\\)-values of the constraining points are both 0. We will soon learn about homogeneous linear systems whose right hand sides are all zero. These homogeneous systems have some very special properties. The \\(q_1, q_2\\) family is “not nice” because it a nonhomogenous system. Just as there is a connection betwen the \\(p_1,p_2\\) family and the \\(q_1, q_2\\) family, we will soon learn that there is a connection between homogeneous systems and nonhomogeneous systems.

Download this Rmd file. First, we will create vectors and matrices Then we will see how to create an augmented matrix and then apply Gaussian Elimination to obtain is reduced row echelon form. Gaussian elimination is performed by the rref() command. However, this command is not loaded into R by default. So we have have to tell RStudio to use the practical math package, which is known as pracma. So we need to run the following command once at the beginning of our session. 7.1 Building Vectors and Matrices A vector in R is a list of data. The simplest way to create a vector is to use the c() command. The letter ‘c’ is short for ‘combine these values into a vector.’ For example, we can make a vector v for the numbers 1,2,3 as follows: ## [1] 1 2 3 Note that we had to ask R to display the value of v. This is because the assignment of v doesn’t echo the value to the console. But can see the value of v in the Environment tab in the upper right panel of RStudio. For example, run this command and then check to see that the value of v gets updated in the environment. It is interesting to note that c() returns a dimensionless vector. So you can treat a vector c() as either a row or a column when you construct a matrix. For example, suppose that we want to make the matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] We could create this matrix by binding three row vectors: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 or we could bind three column vectors: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 7.2 Solving a Linear System Suppose that we want to solve the linear system \\[\\begin{aligned} x + y + z &amp;= 7 \\\\ 2x + 4y + 8z &amp;= 6 \\\\ 3x +9y+27z &amp;=12 \\end{aligned}\\] which has coefficient matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] and target (column) vector \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] This is the same matrix A we defined above. Let’s define a vector b and use cbind() to create an augmented matrix which we will name Ab. (We could have just made the full augmented matrix from the start, but using cbind to add a column to a matrix is a skill we will use later in the course!) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 ## b ## [1,] 1 1 1 4 ## [2,] 2 4 8 6 ## [3,] 3 9 27 12 Now we use the rref() command to apply Gaussian Elimination to produce the reduced row echelon form. (And remember: we had to load this function into R by using the require(pracma) command above.) ## b ## [1,] 1 0 0 7 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -4 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 We conclude that this is a consistent system no free variables. The unique solution is \\[\\begin{align} x&amp;=7\\\\ y&amp;=-4\\\\ z&amp;=1 \\end{align}\\] We can verify that our answer works by multiplying \\(A\\) by one of the solutions above. Matrix multiplication uses the funny operation %*%. ## [,1] ## [1,] 4 ## [2,] 6 ## [3,] 12 Which matches our target \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix} \\] just as we had hoped. 7.3 Solving another Linear System Now let’s find the solution set for the linear system \\[ \\begin{array}{rrrrrcr} x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ 2x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +2x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; 4 \\\\ -x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +x_3 &amp; &amp; &amp; = &amp; 10 \\\\ x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] which corresponds to augmented matrix \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrrrr|r} 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 2 &amp; +1 &amp; +2 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ -1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1 &amp; &amp; &amp; 10 \\\\ 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] This time, let’s just construct the augmented matrix direclty. Then we define the coefficient matrix \\(A\\). Here we use cbind to combine the vectors into the columns of a matrix named \\(A\\). You can use rbind if you want to combine the vectors into the rows of a matrix. ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 ## [2,] 2 1 2 1 5 10 ## [3,] -1 1 1 0 0 4 ## [4,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 And now let’s row reduce to get RREF. ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 1 1 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -1 -1 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 2 3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 So the set of solutions in parametric form is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + s \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + t \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] and this is a “plane” in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). It is in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) because these vectors have 5 coordinates. It is a plane because it is spanned by two vectors that are not on the same line. 7.4 Appendix: Dimensionless Vectors in R Let’s revisit the vector constructed by cbind. Above we called this a “dimensionless” vector because it can be used as a column vector or a row vector. In general, R will do its best to make sense of a dimensionless vector. In other words, it will promote c() to make an expression valid. For example, let \\(A\\) be an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix, and let \\(b\\) be a vector. The expression \\(Av\\) is only defined when \\(v\\) is a \\(n \\times 1\\) column vector and that \\(wA\\) is only defined when \\(w\\) is a \\(1 \\times n\\) ** row vector**. But let’s look at what happens when we use a dimensionless vector instead. ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 -1 0 ## [2,] 1 0 1 ## [3,] 1 1 -1 ## [1] 2 5 11 ## [,1] ## [1,] -3 ## [2,] 13 ## [3,] -4 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 18 9 -6 Both of these multiplications worked! So R treated b as a column vector for the multiplicationA %*% b. And then R treated b as a row vector for the multiplication b %b% A. So how do you make a true column vector or a true row vector? The answer is to use cbind and rbind! Here are some examples: ## [1] 1 2 3 4 ## b ## [1,] 1 ## [2,] 2 ## [3,] 3 ## [4,] 4 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## b 1 2 3 4 "],["d-linear-transformations.html", "Vector 8 2D Linear Transformations 8.1 Functions to plot our vectors 8.2 Your Turn 8.3 Exploration 8.4 Even More Exploration", " Vector 8 2D Linear Transformations Let’s explore linear transformations of the plane! Download this Rmd file. We know that a linear transformation \\(T\\) satisfies \\[ T(c \\mathsf{u} + d \\mathsf{v}) = c\\, T( \\mathsf{u}) +d \\, T( \\mathsf{v}). \\] But what do linear transformations look like? Let’s start to answer this question by considering linear transformations of the plane. We will look at mappings \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\\) where \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = \\mathsf{A} \\mathsf{x}\\) for a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix \\(\\mathsf{A}\\). \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}. \\] The linear transformation \\(T(\\mathsf{x})\\) maps the plane to itself. This nicely allows us to compare vectors before the mapping with their images after the mapping. We can then describe the effect of the mapping on the plane. 8.1 Functions to plot our vectors Here are a couple of helper functions to plot our “before” and “after” vectors as arrows in the plane. This function has four parameters. The parameters before1 and before2 are two vectors before the mapping, and after1 and after2 are their images after the mapping. The function creates a dashed plot of the parallelogram with corners (0,0), before1, before2 and before1+before2. It also creates a solid plot of the image of this parallelogram. These are plotted on the same plane so taht we can easily compare “before” and “after.” Here is an example. Let’s start with vectors \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\). It’s nice to start with vectors of different lengths. Let’s consider the mapping correspoding to multiplication by the matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Here is some example code showing how to make our plot. Note: A %*% x is the syntax for matrix multiplication in R. Figure 8.1: An example 2D linear transformation This visualization uses different colors for the vectors so that you can match up the original vector with its image. There is a lot going on in this mapping, so let’s start making some observations. The original rectangle mapped to a parallelogram. So the shape is ``squished’’ a bit. Both the black vector and the red vector have gotten larger. But we can see that the red vector has grown much more than the black one. So there is expansion, but it is not uniform. The black vector and the red vector have flipped! This means that there is some sort of reflection happening. There isn’t a simple description for what’s happening here. It’s a combination of effects, so that the image of the rectangle is a warped version of the original. 8.2 Your Turn Now it’s your turn. Investigate the effect of each of the following families of mappings. Using the previous code snippet as a guide, create a “before and after plot” for the black vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\) and the red vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\) Describe the effect of the mapping as best you can. Be sure to look at the different effect on the black vector and the red vector. Use words like, expansion, contraction, rotation, reflection and shear. Once you have looked at the effect of the family, look back at the form of the matrix \\(A\\). Can you explain why it leads to the outcome you see? 8.2.1 Family 1 Explore matrices of the form \\[A=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; b \\end{bmatrix}}.\\] Once again, try various combinations of positive, negative, small and large numbers. Here is some sample code that would create such a matrix for \\(a=1\\) and \\(b=1\\). 8.2.2 Family 2 Explore matrices of the form \\[A=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}}.\\] Try various combinations of positive and negative numbers. Also try numbers of small magnitude (less than 1) and large magnitude. 8.2.3 Family 3 Explore matrices of the form \\[A=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(t) &amp; -\\sin(t) \\\\ \\sin(t) &amp; \\cos(t) \\end{bmatrix}}\\] where \\(t\\) is in radians. Here is a function that will create such a matrix. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 6.123234e-17 -1.000000e+00 ## [2,] 1.000000e+00 6.123234e-17 Note: R is numerical software. You’ll note that sin(pi/2) returns a value of 6.123234e-17 or something similar. This value is given in scientific notation, and is \\(\\approx 6.12 \\times 10^{-17}\\). You should treat this tiny number as equal to 0. Be sure to keep an eye out for return values like this that are ``numerically equivalent to 0.’’ 8.2.4 Family 4 Now explore matrices of the form \\[A=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; -b \\\\ b &amp; a \\end{bmatrix}}\\] Once again, consider a wide variety of such matrices. 8.2.5 Some Other Matrices Now try these matrices. For each one, try to make other matrices that have a similar effect. (What is the relationship between the entries that leads to this particular kind of image?) \\[ A=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -3 \\\\ 2 &amp; -6 \\end{bmatrix}}, \\qquad B=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}}, \\qquad C=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}}, \\qquad D=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; 0 \\\\ 3 &amp; 2 \\end{bmatrix}}, \\qquad \\] 8.3 Exploration Now it’s time to explore. Try one or more of the following: Can you find a mapping that will turn the rectangle with corners (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), (0,2) into a square? Look at some different starting vectors. Try some other matrices. What is the relationship between the rank of the matrix and the image of the transformation? 8.4 Even More Exploration For a more interactive experinece, head over to Section 2.6.2 of Understanding Linear Algbra.

You can do this as three matrices that you multiply together. Note: The order of these matrices goes from right to left. The rightmost matrix is the one that is closest to the vector. So that transformation happens first! The matrix A: scale = cbind(c(2,0),c(0,3)) rot = cbind(c(cos(pi/2),sin(pi/2)),c(-sin(pi/2),cos(pi/2))) reflect = cbind(c(-1,0),c(0,1)) A = scale %*% rot %*% reflect plot(house[1,],house[2,],type=&quot;n&quot;,xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(-5,5),xlab=&quot;x&quot;,ylab=&quot;y&quot;) abline(h=-6:6, v=-6:6, col=&quot;gray&quot;, lty=&quot;dotted&quot;) house2 = A %*% house polygon(house[1,], house[2,], col = &quot;gray&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) polygon(house2[1,], house2[2,], col = &quot;pink&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) 9.6.1 Your Turn Using the previous example as a guide, create a complicated mapping of your own that combines some of the linear transformations above.
