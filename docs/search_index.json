The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area. Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying). Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\). Use RStudio to find the solution set. Write your answer in parametric form. Your answer to part 2 finds an infinite solution set. In terms of traffic flow, explain why there can be more than one solution. Thinking about cars traveling along streets, why is there some flexibility in the overall flow of cars? Now critique the model as presented. What solutions to the linear system are problematic for our original traffic flow problem? What additional conditions should we require for a valid solution? 1.5 Parabolas Through Two Points You will find the family of all possible parabolas \\[ f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \\] through two given points. Note that there will be an infinite number of such polynomials: there are three unknowns, but only two constraints. So there will be at least one free variable. Here are the plots of the two different families of parabolas that you will consider. For each pair of points below: Create linear system that represents the problem Use RStudio to find the RREF of the augmented matrix for the system and Write down the general formula for the family of parabolas \\(f(x)\\) that contain the points. Here are the pairs of points. \\(p_1 = (1,0)\\) and \\(p_2 = (5,0)\\) \\(q_1= (1,-3)\\) and \\(q_2 = (5,10)\\) Part (a.i) characterizes the family of parabolas that contain the points \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\). Let’s refer to this family of parabolas as our “\\(p_1,p_2\\) family.” Pick any two functions \\(g_1(x)\\) and \\(g_2(x)\\) from this \\(p_1,p_2\\) family of parabolas. Now consider the parabola \\[ g(x) = g_1(x) - g_2(x). \\] Show that \\(g(1)=0\\) and \\(g(5)=0\\). This means that \\(g(x)\\) is also in our \\(p_1,p_2\\) family! (That’s really cool!) Part (a.ii) characterizes the family of parabolas that contain the points \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\). Let’s refer to this family of parabolas as our “\\(q_1,q_2\\) family.” Pick any two functions \\(h_1(x)\\) and \\(h_2(x)\\) in this \\(q_1,q_2\\) family. Now consider the parabola \\[ h(x) = h_1(x) - h_2(x). \\] Show that \\(h(1) \\neq -3\\) and \\(h(5) \\neq 10\\). This means that \\(h(x)\\) is NOT in our \\(q_1,q_2\\) family. (So this family is not as nice as the previous one.) Now explain why the parabola \\(h(x)\\) from part 3 is actually a member of the \\(p_1, p_2\\) family. (So maybe this family is nicer than we thought!) Remark: This problem is about families of parabolas. But at its core, this is actually a problem about linear algebra. Obviously, we used linear algebra to solve part 1, but there is linear algebra in the other parts as well! We define \\(g(x) = g_1(x) - g_2(x)\\) by taking a linear combination of two functions. (Just like we take linear combinations of vectors.) What leads to the “nice” behavior of the \\(p_1, p_2\\) family in part 2? It’s because the \\(y\\)-values of the constraining points are both 0. We will soon learn about homogeneous linear systems whose right hand sides are all zero. These homogeneous systems have some very special properties. The \\(q_1, q_2\\) family is “not nice” because it a nonhomogenous system. Just as there is a connection betwen the \\(p_1,p_2\\) family and the \\(q_1, q_2\\) family, we will soon learn that there is a connection between homogeneous systems and nonhomogeneous systems. "],["important-definitions.html", "Section 2 Important Definitions 2.1 Vector Spaces 2.2 Matrices 2.3 Orthogonality 2.4 Spectral Decompostion", " Section 2 Important Definitions 2.1 Vector Spaces span A set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) span a vector space \\(V\\) if for every \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in V\\) there exist a set of scalars (weights) \\(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\[ \\mathsf{v} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n. \\] Connection to Matrices: If \\(A = [\\mathsf{v}_1 \\mathsf{v}_2 \\cdots \\mathsf{v}_n]\\) is the matrix with these vectors in the columns, then this is the same as saying that \\(\\mathsf{x} = [c_1, \\ldots, c_n]^{\\top}\\) is a solution to \\(A x = \\mathsf{v}\\). linear independence A set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2,\\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) are linearly independent if the only way to write \\[ \\mathsf{0} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n \\] is with \\(c_1 = c_2 = \\cdots = c_n = 0\\). Connection to Matrices: If \\(A = [\\mathsf{v}_1 \\mathsf{v}_2 \\cdots \\mathsf{v}_n]\\) is the matrix with these vectors in the columns, then this is the same as saying that \\(A x = \\mathsf{0}\\) has only the trivial solution. linear dependence Conversely, a set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) are linearly dependent if there exist scalars \\(c_1, c_2,\\ldots, c_n \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) that are not all equal to 0 such that \\[ \\mathsf{0} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n \\] This is called a dependence relation among the vectors. Connection to Matrices: If \\(A = [\\mathsf{v}_1 \\mathsf{v}_2 \\cdots \\mathsf{v}_n]\\) is the matrix with these vectors in the columns, then this is the same as saying that \\(\\mathsf{x} = [c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n]^{\\top}\\) is a nontrivial solution to \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{0}\\). linear transformation A function \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a linear transformation when: \\(T(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{v}) = T(\\mathsf{u}) + T(\\mathsf{v})\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u}, \\mathsf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) (preserves addition) \\(T(c \\mathsf{u} ) = c T(\\mathsf{u})\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) (preserves scalar multiplication). It follows from these that also \\(T(\\mathsf{0}) = \\mathsf{0}\\). one-to-one A function \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a one-to-one when: for all \\(\\mathsf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) there is at most one \\(\\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = \\mathsf{y}\\). onto A function \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a onto when: for all \\(\\mathsf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) there is at least one \\(\\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = \\mathsf{y}\\). subspace A subset \\(S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a subspace when: \\(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{v} \\in S\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u}, \\mathsf{v} \\in S\\) (closed under addition) \\(c \\mathsf{u} \\in S\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u}\\in S\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) (closed under scalar multiplication) It follows from these that also \\(\\mathsf{0} \\in S\\). basis A basis of a vector space (or subspace) \\(V\\) is a set of vectors \\(\\mathcal{B} = \\{\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\}\\) in \\(V\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) span \\(V\\) \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) are linearly independent Equivalently, one can say that \\(\\mathcal{B} = \\{\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\}\\) is a basis of \\(V\\) if for every vector \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in V\\) there is a unique set of scalars \\(c_1, \\ldots, c_n\\) such that \\[ \\mathsf{v} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n. \\] (The fact that there is a set of vectors comes from the span; the fact that they are unique comes from linear independence). dimension The dimension of a subspace \\(W\\) is the number of vectors in any basis of \\(W\\). This is also the fewest number of vectors required to span the subspace. 2.2 Matrices invertible The square \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is invertible when there exists an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A^{-1}\\) such that \\(A A^{-1} = I = A^{-1} A\\). The Invertible Matrix Theorem collects over two dozen equivalent conditions, each of which guarantees that \\(A\\) is invertible. null space The null space \\(\\mbox{Nul}(A) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) of the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is the set of solutions to the homogeneous equation \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathbf{0}\\)&gt; We also write this as \\[ \\mbox{Nul}(A) = \\{ \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathbf{0} \\} \\] Connection to Linear Transformations: If \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = A \\mathsf{x}\\), then the kernel of \\(T\\) is the null space of matrix \\(A\\). column space The column space \\(\\mbox{Col}(A) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m\\) of the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of \\(A\\). For \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathsf{a}_1 &amp; \\mathsf{a}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathsf{a}_n \\end{bmatrix}\\), we have \\[ \\mbox{Col}(A) = \\mbox{span} ( \\mathsf{a}_1, \\mathsf{a}_2, \\ldots , \\mathsf{a}_n ) \\] We also write this as \\[ \\mbox{Col}(A) = \\{ \\mathsf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m : \\mathsf{b} = A \\mathsf{x} \\mbox{ for some } \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\}. \\] Connection to Linear Transformations: If \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = A \\mathsf{x}\\), then the range (also called the image) of \\(T\\) is the column space of matrix \\(A\\). rank The rank of the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is the dimension of the column space of \\(A\\). This is also the number of pivot columns of the matrix. eigenvalue and eigenvector For a square \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), the scalar \\(\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is an eigenvalue for \\(A\\) when there exists a nonzero vector \\(\\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\lambda \\mathsf{x}\\). The nonzero vector \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) is the eigenvector for eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\). The collection of all of these eigenvalues and eigenvectors is called the eigensystem of A. diagonalization A square \\(n \\times n\\) matrix is diagonalizable when \\(A = P D P^{-1}\\) where \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix and \\(P\\) is an invertible matrix. In this case, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the diagonal entries of \\(D\\) and their corresponding eigenvectors are the columns of \\(P\\). dominant eigenvalue The eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) of the square matrix \\(A\\) is the dominant eigenvalue when \\(| \\lambda | &gt; | \\mu |\\) where \\(\\mu\\) is any other eigenvalue of \\(A\\). The dominant eigenvalue determines the long-term behavior of \\(A^t\\) as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\). 2.3 Orthogonality length The length of a vector \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is \\[ \\| \\mathsf{v} \\| = \\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \\cdots + v_n^2}. \\] distance and angle The distance between vectors \\(\\mathsf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is \\[ \\mbox{dist}(\\mathsf{u},\\mathsf{v}) = \\| \\mathsf{u} - \\mathsf{v} \\|. \\] The angle \\(\\theta\\) between these vectors is determined by \\[ \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\mathsf{u} \\cdot \\mathsf{v}}{ \\| \\mathsf{u} \\| \\, \\| \\mathsf{v} \\|}. \\] orthogonal The vectors \\(\\mathsf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) are orthogonal when \\(\\mathsf{u} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} = 0\\). This means that either one of them is the zero vector, or they are perpendicular to one another. orthogonal complement If \\(W \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a subspace, then its orthogonal complement \\(W^{\\perp}\\) is the set of all vectors in \\(\\mathsf{R}^n\\) that are orthogonal to \\(W\\). We also write \\[ W^{\\perp} = \\{ \\mathsf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{w} \\mbox{ for all } \\mathsf{w} \\in W \\}. \\] orthonormal set A collection of vectors \\(\\mathsf{u}_1, \\mathsf{u}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{u}_k\\) are an orthonormal set when every vector has length 1 and the vectors are pairwise orthogonal. orthogonal matrix orthogonal matrix A square \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(P\\) is an orthogonal matrix when its columns are an orthonormal set. As a result, we have \\(P^{-1} = P^{\\top}\\). projection and residual The orthogonal projection of vector \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) into a subspace \\(W\\) is the unique vector \\(\\hat{\\mathsf{y}} \\in W\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{z} = \\mathsf{y} - \\hat{\\mathsf{y}} \\in W^{\\perp}\\). The vector \\(\\mathsf{z}\\) is called the residual vector for the projection. 2.4 Spectral Decompostion orthogonal diagonalization Every symmetric \\(n \\times n\\) matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable, meaning that we have \\(A = P D P^{\\top}\\) where \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix and \\(P\\) is an orthogonal matrix. The diagonal entries of \\(D\\) are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) and the columns of \\(P\\) are the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors. Furthermore, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are nonnegative. spectral decomposition A symmetric matrix \\(A\\) can be written as a linear combination of rank 1 matrices derived from the orthonormal eigensystem of \\(A\\). In particular, we have \\[ A = \\lambda_1 \\mathsf{u}_1 \\mathsf{u}_1^{\\top} + \\lambda_2 \\mathsf{u}_2 \\mathsf{u}_2^{\\top} + \\cdots + \\lambda_n \\mathsf{u}_n \\mathsf{u}_n^{\\top}. \\] This linear combination of rank 1 vectors is called the spectral decomposition of \\(A\\). singular value decomposition (SVD) Any \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) of rank \\(r\\) can be factored into its singular value decomposition \\(U \\Sigma V^{\\top}\\) where \\(U\\) is an \\(m \\times m\\) orthogonal matrix, \\(\\Sigma\\) is a matrix whose nonzero entries are the positive numbers \\(\\sigma_1, \\ldots , \\sigma_r\\), which appear in decreasing order on the diagonal, and \\(V\\) is an \\(n \\times n\\) orthogonal matrix. The nonzero entries of \\(\\Sigma\\) are called the singular values of \\(A\\). The columns of \\(U\\) are the left singular vectors and the rows of \\(V^{\\top}\\) are the right singular vectors. SVD spectral decomposition Any \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) of rank \\(r\\) can be written as a linear combination of rank 1 matrices derived from the singular value decomposition of \\(A\\). In particular, we have \\[ A = \\sigma_1 \\mathsf{u}_1 \\mathsf{v}_1^{\\top} + \\sigma_2 \\mathsf{u}_2 \\mathsf{v}_2^{\\top} + \\cdots + \\sigma_r \\mathsf{u}_r \\mathsf{v}_r^{\\top}. \\] This linear combination of rank 1 vectors is called the (SVD) spectral decomposition of \\(A\\).

A subspace is a subset of a vector space that is also a vector space by itself (closed under linear combinations). The solutions to \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathbb{0}\\) form a subspace. The span of the columns of \\(A\\) form a subspace. How the kernel and image of \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = Ax\\) correspond to the nullspace and columnspace of \\(A\\). Every basis of a given vector space (or subspace) contains the same number of vectors. Why every vector in a vector space has a unique representation as a linear combination of a given basis \\({\\mathcal{B}}\\). How dimension relates to span and linear independence. Interpret \\(\\det(A)\\) as a measure the expansion/contraction of “volumes” in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) under the linear transformation \\(T(\\mathsf{x})=A\\mathsf{x}\\).

Find the eigenvalues and (“human readable”) eigenvectors of an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) using eigen(A) on RStudio. Determine whether a matrix is diagonalizable.

An eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) with \\(1 &lt;| \\lambda |\\) corresponds to expansion. An eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) with \\(0 &lt; | \\lambda | &lt; 1\\) corresponds to contraction. A complex eigenvalue corresponds to a rotation in a 2D subspace. The eigenspace for \\(\\lambda\\) is the subspace \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A - \\lambda I)\\). A matrix is not diagonalizable when it has complex eigenvalues. A matrix is not diagonalizable when it has an eigenvalue whose algebraic mutiplicity is strictly larger than its geometrix multiplicity. The Gould Index measures the centrality of a vertex in the network. The eigenvalues of a matrix “encode some of the patterns” found in the matrix. Larger magnitude eigenvalues indicate more important patterns. The long-term behavior of a dynamical system is determined by its dominent eigenvalue and eigenvector.
