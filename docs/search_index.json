Decide whether the set of solutions is a point, line, plane, or the empty set in 3-space. Briefly justify your answer. \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 5 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 6 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) 1.2 Find the Parametric Solution Each of the following matrices is the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations.

For each of them, Describe the row operation that turns \\(A\\) into \\(B\\), and Describe the row operation that turns \\(B\\) into \\(A\\). Give your answers in the form: “scale \\(R_2\\) by 3” or “swap \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_4\\)” or “replace \\(R_3\\) with \\(R_3 + \\frac{1}{5} R_1\\).” \\[A=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\longrightarrow B=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; 0 &amp; -4 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\] \\[A=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\longrightarrow B=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\] \\[A=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\longrightarrow B=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\] 1.4 Traffic Flow Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction. The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area. Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying). Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\). Use RStudio to find the solution set. Write your answer in parametric form. Your answer to part 2 finds an infinite solution set. In terms of traffic flow, explain why there can be more than one solution. Thinking about cars traveling along streets, why is there some flexibility in the overall flow of cars? Now critique the model as presented. What solutions to the linear system are problematic for our original traffic flow problem? What additional conditions should we require for a valid solution? 1.5 Parabolas Through Two Points You will find the family of all possible parabolas \\[ f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \\] through two given points. Note that there will be an infinite number of such polynomials: there are three unknowns, but only two constraints. So there will be at least one free variable. Here are the plots of the two different families of parabolas that you will consider. For each pair of points, (a) create linear system that represents the problem (b) use RStudio to find the RREF of the augmented matrix for the system and (c) write down the general formula for the family of parabolas \\(f(x)\\) that contain the points. \\(p_1 = (1,0)\\) and \\(p_2 = (5,0)\\) \\(q_1= (1,-3)\\) and \\(q_2 = (5,10)\\) Part 1.1 characterizes the family of parabolas that contain the points \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\). Let’s refer to this family of parabolas as our “\\(p_1,p_2\\) family.” Pick any two functions \\(g_1(x)\\) and \\(g_2(x)\\) from this \\(p_1,p_2\\) family of parabolas. Now consider the parabola \\[ g(x) = g_1(x) - g_2(x). \\] Show that \\(g(1)=0\\) and \\(g(5)=0\\). This means that \\(g(x)\\) is also in our \\(p_1,p_2\\) family! (That’s really cool!) Part 1.2 characterizes the family of parabolas that contain the points \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\). Let’s refer to this family of parabolas as our “\\(q_1,q_2\\) family.” Pick any two functions \\(h_1(x)\\) and \\(h_2(x)\\) in this \\(q_1,q_2\\) family. Now consider the parabola \\[ h(x) = h_1(x) - h_2(x). \\] Show that \\(h(1) \\neq -3\\) and \\(h(5) \\neq 10\\). This means that \\(h(x)\\) is NOT in our \\(q_1,q_2\\) family. (So this family is not as nice as the previous one.) Now explain why the parabola \\(h(x)\\) from part 3 is actually a member of the \\(p_1, p_2\\) family. (So maybe this family is nicer than we thought!) Remark: This problem is about families of parabolas. But at its core, this is actually a problem about linear algebra. Obviously, we used linear algebra to solve part 1, but there is linear algebra in the other parts as well! We define \\(g(x) = g_1(x) - g_2(x)\\) by taking a linear combination of two functions. (Just like we take linear combinations of vectors.) What leads to the “nice” behavior of the \\(p_1, p_2\\) family in part 2? It’s because the \\(y\\)-values of the constraining points are both 0. We will soon learn about homogeneous linear systems whose right hand sides are all zero. These homogeneous systems have some very special properties. The \\(q_1, q_2\\) family is “not nice” because it a nonhomogenous system. Just as there is a connection betwen the \\(p_1,p_2\\) family and the \\(q_1, q_2\\) family, we will soon learn that there is a connection between homogeneous systems and nonhomogeneous systems.

Download this Rmd file. First, we will create vectors and matrices Then we will see how to create an augmented matrix and then apply Gaussian Elimination to obtain is reduced row echelon form. Gaussian elimination is performed by the rref() command. However, this command is not loaded into R by default. So we have have to tell RStudio to use the practical math package, which is known as pracma. So we need to run the following command once at the beginning of our session. require(pracma) 4.1 Building Vectors and Matrices A vector in R is a list of data. The simplest way to create a vector is to use the c() command. The letter ‘c’ is short for ‘combine these values into a vector.’ For example, we can make a vector v for the numbers 1,2,3 as follows: v=c(1,2,3) v ## [1] 1 2 3 Note that we had to ask R to display the value of v. This is because the assignment of v doesn’t echo the value to the console. But can see the value of v in the Environment tab in the upper right panel of RStudio. For example, run this command and then check to see that the value of v gets updated in the environment. v=c(1,2,3,4,5,6) It is interesting to note that c() returns a dimensionless vector. So you can treat a vector c() as either a row or a column when you construct a matrix. For example, suppose that we want to make the matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] We could create this matrix by binding three row vectors: A = rbind(c(1,1,1), c(2,4,8), c(3,9,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 or we could bind three column vectors: A = cbind(c(1,2,3), c(1,4,9), c(1,8,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 4.2 Solving a Linear System Suppose that we want to solve the linear system \\[\\begin{aligned} x + y + z &amp;= 7 \\\\ 2x + 4y + 8z &amp;= 6 \\\\ 3x +9y+27z &amp;=12 \\end{aligned}\\] which has coefficient matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] and target (column) vector \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] This is the same matrix A we defined above. Let’s define a vector b and use cbind() to create an augmented matrix which we will name Ab. (We could have just made the full augmented matrix from the start, but using cbind to add a column to a matrix is a skill we will use later in the course!) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 b = c(4,6,12) Ab = cbind(A,b) Ab ## b ## [1,] 1 1 1 4 ## [2,] 2 4 8 6 ## [3,] 3 9 27 12 Now we use the rref() command to apply Gaussian Elimination to produce the reduced row echelon form. (And remember: we had to load this function into R by using the require(pracma) command above.) rref(Ab) ## b ## [1,] 1 0 0 7 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -4 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 We conclude that this is a consistent system no free variables. The unique solution is \\[\\begin{align} x&amp;=7\\\\ y&amp;=-4\\\\ z&amp;=1 \\end{align}\\] We can verify that our answer works by multiplying \\(A\\) by one of the solutions above. Matrix multiplication uses the funny operation %*%. A %*% c(7,-4,1) ## [,1] ## [1,] 4 ## [2,] 6 ## [3,] 12 #A %*% c(1,2,3,0,0) Which matches our target \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix} \\] just as we had hoped. 4.3 Solving another Linear System Now let’s find the solution set for the linear system \\[ \\begin{array}{rrrrrcr} x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ 2x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +2x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; 4 \\\\ -x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +x_3 &amp; &amp; &amp; = &amp; 10 \\\\ x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] which corresponds to augmented matrix \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrrrr|r} 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 2 &amp; +1 &amp; +2 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ -1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1 &amp; &amp; &amp; 10 \\\\ 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] This time, let’s just construct the augmented matrix direclty. Then we define the coefficient matrix \\(A\\). Here we use cbind to combine the vectors into the columns of a matrix named \\(A\\). You can use rbind if you want to combine the vectors into the rows of a matrix. Ab = cbind(c(1,2,-1,1),c(0,1,1,0),c(-1,2,1,-1),c(-1,1,0,-1),c(-1,5,0,-1),c(-2,10,4,-2)) Ab ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 ## [2,] 2 1 2 1 5 10 ## [3,] -1 1 1 0 0 4 ## [4,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 And now let’s row reduce to get RREF. rref(Ab) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 1 1 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -1 -1 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 2 3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 So the set of solutions in parametric form is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + s \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + t \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] and this is a “plane” in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). It is in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) because these vectors have 5 coordinates. It is a plane because it is spanned by two vectors that are not on the same line. 4.4 Appendix: Dimensionless Vectors in R Let’s revisit the vector constructed by cbind. Above we called this a “dimensionless” vector because it can be used as a column vector or a row vector. In general, R will do its best to make sense of a dimensionless vector. In other words, it will promote c() to make an expression valid. For example, let \\(A\\) be an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix, and let \\(b\\) be a vector. The expression \\(Av\\) is only defined when \\(v\\) is a \\(n \\times 1\\) column vector and that \\(wA\\) is only defined when \\(w\\) is a \\(1 \\times n\\) ** row vector**. But let’s look at what happens when we use a dimensionless vector instead. A = cbind(c(1,1,1),c(-1,0,1), c(0,1,-1)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 -1 0 ## [2,] 1 0 1 ## [3,] 1 1 -1 b = c(2,5,11) b ## [1] 2 5 11 # A times b A %*% b ## [,1] ## [1,] -3 ## [2,] 13 ## [3,] -4 # b times A b %*% A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 18 9 -6 Both of these multiplications worked! So R treated b as a column vector for the multiplicationA %*% b. And then R treated b as a row vector for the multiplication b %b% A. So how do you make a true column vector or a true row vector? The answer is to use cbind and rbind! Here are some examples: # dimensionless b = c(1,2,3,4) b ## [1] 1 2 3 4 # column vector b.col = cbind(b) b.col ## b ## [1,] 1 ## [2,] 2 ## [3,] 3 ## [4,] 4 # row vector b.row = rbind(b) b.row ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## b 1 2 3 4 "]]
