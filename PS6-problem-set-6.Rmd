The Problem Set covers sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5 and Network Analysis. 






## The Square Root of a Matrix?

The matrix $A  =\begin{bmatrix} 7 & 2 \\ -4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ has characteristic polynomial
$\lambda^2 - 8 \lambda + 15 = (\lambda -3)(\lambda - 5).$


a. Describe the eigenspaces of $A$.
a. Diagonalize $A$.
a. Find a matrix that makes sense to call $\sqrt{A}$. Then show that when you square this matrix, you really do get matrix $A$.

## A  Matrix Mystery

An unknown $3 \times 3$ matrix $M$ has eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues:
$$
\mathsf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \  \lambda_1 = 1;
\qquad
\mathsf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix},\  \lambda_2 = \frac{9}{10};
\qquad
\mathsf{v}_3 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},\  \lambda_3 = 0.
$$

a. Find (exactly, if possible, or approximately otherwise) the vector $M^{10} \mathsf{v}$ where $\mathsf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}7\\3\\4\end{bmatrix}$.

a.  Describe all vectors $\mathsf{v}$, if there are any, such that $M^{n} \mathsf{v}  \to {\bf 0}$ as $n \to \infty$.

a.  Is it possible to reconstruct $M$ from the evidence given? If so, then do it!  If not, explain what further information is needed.






## Upper Triangular Matrix with a Constant Diagonal

Let $A$ be a $3 \times 3$ upper triangular matrix of the form
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
d & a & b \\
0  & d & c \\
0 & 0 & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where $d \neq 0$ and at least one of $a,b,c$ is nonzero. Explain why $A$ is not diagonalizable.




## Block Diagonalization of a  $4 \times 4$ Matrix


The $4 \times 4$ matrix
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\
1 & -3 & 3 & 2 \\
2 & -9 & 7 & 0 \\
2 & -4 & 2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
has complex eigenvalues $a \pm bi$ and $c \pm di$. 

a. Use RStudio to find the eigenvalues $a \pm bi$ and $c \pm di$, as well as "human friendly" eigenvectors 

    + $\mathsf{v} = \mathsf{v}_1 + i \mathsf{v}_2$ for eigenvalue $a + bi$, and 
    + $\mathsf{w} = \mathsf{w}_1 + i \mathsf{w}_2$ for eigenvalue $c + di$. 

    Hint: the command `zapsmall()` might be helpful.


a. This matrix A can be factored as $A  =  P B P^{-1}$ where $B$ is a "block diagonal"  matrix of the form
$$
B = \begin{bmatrix} a & -b & 0  & 0 \\
b & a & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & c & -d \\
0 & 0 & d & c 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
and
$$
P = \begin{bmatrix} \mathrm{Im} (\mathsf{v}) & \mathrm{Re} (\mathsf{v}) &  \mathrm{Im} (\mathsf{w}) & \mathrm{Re}( \mathsf{w})
\end{bmatrix}
=\begin{bmatrix} \mathsf{v}_2 & \mathsf{v}_1 &  \mathsf{w}_2 &  \mathsf{w}_1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where the constants $a,b,c,d$ and the vectors $\mathsf{v}, \mathsf{w}$ are as described in part (a). Use RStudio to find the $4 \times 4$ matrix $P$ and its inverse $P^{-1}$. 

    Hints: 

    * You can use  the command `solve(M)` to find the inverse of matrix $M$.
    * You can confirm that your answer is correct by computing $P B P^{-1}$ and checking that this equals the original matrix $A$.



## Network Analysis of Risk Territories.

*Risk* is a classic board game of conflict and diplomacy played on a map of the world. Players try to capture territories my moving their armies through adjancent territories. Here is what the game map looks like, with the countries colored by continent.

![Risk Game Board (image: wikipedia)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Risk_game_map_fixed.png/800px-Risk_game_map_fixed.png){width=80%}



</center>

Here is a network representation of the gameboard, created from an adjacency matrix.

```{r networkRisk, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, echo=TRUE}
library(igraph)

risk <- read.csv("https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20/main/data/riskmatrix.csv")
A = data.matrix(risk)
countries =  names(risk)
g=graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A,mode='undirected')

coords = layout_nicely(g)
plot(g, layout=coords, vertex.size = 10, vertex.label.cex=0.75, vertex.color='khaki', vertex.frame.color="black")

```

Calculate Gould's Index for this network. Use the Gould's index ranking to **identify the most central territory in each of the six continents** (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America). [Here is a list of territories by continent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)#Territories) to help you to classify the territories.

Turn in a table with six rows, one for each continent. These six rows should be ordered by Gould's index. Each row should contain: 

* name of the continent
* name of the territory with the largest Gould Index,
* the degree of the territory,
* the Gould's Index value for the territory.

You do not need to show your work for this problem.
