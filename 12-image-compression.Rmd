# SVD and Image Compression


Today we will use the `svd` command to find the Singular Value Decomposition of an $m \times n$ matrix.
We will practice reading the output of this command and finding bases for the four fundamental subspaces of a matrix.
Then we will look at a cool application of SVD: image compression!

## Singular Value Decomposition.

Let's start by looking at the SVD for a couple of matrices. For each one: 

a. Determine the rank of $A$
b. Identify the basis for each of the four fundamental subspaces
$$
\mbox{Nul}(A), \qquad \mbox{Col}(A), \qquad \mbox{Row}(A), \qquad \mbox{Nul}(A^{\top}).
$$
c. Pick a vector $\mathsf{x}$ from the basis for $\mbox{Nul}(A)$ and confirm that $A \mathsf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.
d. Pick a vector $\mathsf{y}$ from the basis for $\mbox{Col}(A)$ and confirm that $\mathsf{y}$ can be written as the a linear combination of the columns of $A$.
e. Find the spectral decomposition of $A$
f. Use the spectral decomposition to create approximations of matrix $A$ and then compare the quality of the approximation to the size of the gaps of the singular values.



### SVD Example 1

```{r, echo=TRUE}
(A = cbind(c(1,-1,1,0),c(-2,3,0,2),c(1,-1,1,0),c(0,1,4,0),c(1,-1,5,-4)))

```


### SVD Example 2

```{r, echo=TRUE}
(A = cbind(c(-3,5,-3,6,-1),c(-1,-2,-1,2,-4),c(9,-4,9,-18,14),c(3,-4,3,-6,3),c(-2,11,-2,4,11)))

```


### SVD Example 3

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
(A = cbind(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3))

```


## Image Compression



### Converting a JPEG image into a Matrix

You may need to install the `jpeg` and `raster` packages. To check, your should

* Click on the 'Packages' tab in the lower right window
* Either search or scroll to see if the the `jpeg` and `raster` are there. 
* If so, then click the checkbox to load the package into memory.
If the package is missing, then uncomment and run  the folllowing code chunk
```{r}
#install.packages('jpeg')
#install.packages('raster')
```

You've probably heard of JPEG image files. The `jpeg` package will allow us to import those images into R. The JPEG format uses image compression. So we need to turn them into a **raster (bitmap) image** which is a rectangular grid of pixels or dots. In other words a raster image is a matrix. The package `raster` will do this conversion for us.

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(jpeg)
library(raster)
```





The following defines two helper functions

* `get_image(filename)` reads in a JPEG file and convert it into a raster image.
* `plot_image(img)` creates a plot of the raster image

```{r}


# converts a JPEG file into a raster image (a numerical matrix)
# if the JPEG is a color image, it is converted to black and white.
get_image <- function(filename) {
  # read the jpeg file
  img = readJPEG(readBin(filename,"raw",1e6))
  img.dim = dim(img)
  
  # if this is a color image, we need to turn it into a grayscale image
  img = img[,,1]+img[,,2]+img[,,3]
  img <- img/max(img)
  img.dim = dim(img)
  
  return (img)
}


plot_image = function(img,...) {
  plot(2:1, type='n',xlab=" ",ylab= " ",...)
  rasterImage(img, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0)
}




```



Let start by reading in a picture of a tartan.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
where.tartan = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Burberry.jpg"
img = get_image(where.tartan)
#plot_image(img,main="Image")

dim(img)
prod(dim(img)) # prod(vec) = product of the entries of vec


```


Each entry of `img` is a value in $[0,1]$. This is the  **grayscale value** of a single pixel: value 0 corresponds to white and value 1 corresponds to black.  The matrix `img` is a $335 \times 333$ matrix. So to store the image, we need to store $111,555$  floating point numbers (!). You can see compression methods are essential in practice.



### SVD of a Raster Image


The `img` variable is just a matrix. So we can find its singular value decomposition. We find that there are some large gaps in the singular values.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
decomp =svd(img)$d
#plot(decomp,pch=19,cex=.5,col='blue')
#plot(decomp,pch=19,cex=.5,col='blue',ylim=c(0,5))
decomp[1:10]
```

### SVD Approximation of the image


Now let's create an SVD approximation of the image. Here is some helper code for us to use. The functions that you will call are

* `plot_svd_approx(img, k)`: create the spectral decomposition corresponding to the $k$ largest singular values in the spectral decomposition.
* `get_svd_approx_error(img, k)`: reports the average pixel error of the approximation.
```{r,echo=TRUE}

# returns the spectral decomposition matrix for the first k singular values
svd_approx = function(A,k = floor(1/2*min(nrow(A),ncol(A)))) {
  decomp = svd(A)
  sings = decomp$d
  U = decomp$u
  V = decomp$v
  if(k==1)
    D=matrix(sings[1],nrow=1,ncol=1)
  else
    D=diag(sings[1:k])
  M=U[,1:k]%*%D%*%t(V[,1:k])
  return(M)
}


# gets the svd approximation of the image
get_svd_approx_img <- function(img,k) {
  approxIm = svd_approx(img,k)
  approxIm[approxIm<0] = 0
  approxIm[approxIm>1] = 1
  
  return (approxIm)
}

# returns the average pixel error for the svd approximation of the image
get_svd_approx_error <-  function(img, k) {
  approxImg = get_svd_approx_img(img,k)
  return  = mean(abs(img - approxImg))
}

# plots the SVD approximation of the image
plot_svd_approx=function(img,k){
  approxIm = get_svd_approx_img(img,k)
  plot(1:2, type='n')
  rasterImage(approxIm, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0)

}




```

And here we show the singular value approximation with increasing numbers of singular values:
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
#plot_svd_approx(img,1)
get_svd_approx_error(img,1)
```


### SVD of a Lighthouse

Now let's see how SVD does with this picture of a lighthouse. Use the appropriate code above to explore the SVD approximations of this lighthouse. How big must $k$ be in order to get an okay approximation? to get an approximation that you can't distinguish from the original?


```{r}
where.lighthouse  = "https://images.unsplash.com/6/lighthouse.jpg"
```


### Your Turn

Here are some JPG files available on the web for you to try. Or you can use an image of your own choice! Have fun!
```{r}

# some jpeg images available on the web
where.cameraman = "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/cameraman_small.jpg"
where.tiger = "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f2/b5/0b/f2b50b1cbdb7cd16fef50f5641d41e77.jpg"
where.flower= "https://www.amylamb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Gerbera-320x320.jpg"
where.pattern  = "https://previews.123rf.com/images/noppanun/noppanun1411/noppanun141100046/33287656-black-and-white-geometric-seamless-pattern-with-triangle-and-trapezoid-abstract-background-vector-ep.jpg"
